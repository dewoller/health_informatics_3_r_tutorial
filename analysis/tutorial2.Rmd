# Putting your commands in files
Create a new Rmd notebook file (file -> new_ -> R notebook). Save your file, by going to File -> Save as -> Tutorial2.Rmd

# Importing Health Data

## Download data from the web
This tutorial will work with health data, specifically, the same data we used in the second Tableau tutorial. The data is in a zip file. [Download cardiac.zip](assets/cardiac.zip) to your desktop.  It contains the two datasets as csv files, cardiac_diagnosis.csv and cardiac_procedures.csv.

## Upload data to Rstudio
We will upload the cardiac zip datafile to Rstudio, by using the Files-> Upload, found in Files tab of the bottom right quadrant.

```{r 5_file_upload.jpg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Files tab", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial2_5_file_upload.jpg")
```

```{r 6_file_upload_2.jpg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Upload file selection box", out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial2_6_file_upload_2.jpg")
```
Rstudio has unzipped the files for you.  You can now see the uploaded cardiac files in the Files tab.

```{r 7_file_upload_done.jpg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Uploaded files complete", out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial2_7_file_upload_done.jpg")
```
## Reading in CSV files

The best way to read CSV files into R is by using the read_csv function. Type the following code into your Rscript file, and press Ctrl-enter.

```{r }

read_csv("cardiac_procedures.csv")

```
## Reading CSV files into the environment

Read the CSV procedures data into the cardiac_procedures variable in the R environment, so that it is handy to use repeatedly.

```{r }

cardiac_procedures <- read_csv("cardiac_procedures.csv")

```

### Exercises

1.  Read in the cardiac_diagnosis.csv file. What fields are in it?

1.  Read the cardiac_diagnosis.csv file into the cardiac_diagnosis tibble

# Piping data between functions

The best thing about R, and language in general, is that you can build up meaningful phrases based on relatively simple fragments.  For example, ggplot produces many different graphs by combining two types of chunks, `ggplot` and `geom_` functions, joining the chunks of the phrase using the plus sign `+` .

When we combine tidyverse *data* phrases, we call it a data pipeline, and we join them using the pipe symbol, `%>%` .

For example, the following command finds all the distinct block descriptions in the cardiac procedures dataset.

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  distinct( block_desc )

```
##  `select` and `filter` functions

There are many functions that can be used in a pipe.  Some useful ones that you will recognise are `select` and `filter`. `select` is for selecting columns, whereas `filter` selects out specific rows, just like the `where` clause in SQL.

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  select( drg, sex_desc )

```

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  filter( sex_desc == 'Female')

```

### Exercises

1.  How do you select the diagnosis description?

1.  How would you see the ages and lengths of stay of men who had a cardiac procedure?

1.  How many different seperation modes are there?  How many drg's?

## `count` and `head` functions

The `count` function is a two step function.  It groups all unique values together (like `distinct`), summarising the result by counting.  The equivalent in SQL would be `COUNT(*)` and `GROUP BY`.

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  count( procedure_short_desc )

```

If we add `sort = TRUE` to `count`, the results are sorted in descending order.

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  count( procedure_short_desc, sort = TRUE )

```
# Two step pipes
## Top N queries

If we add the `head(5)` function to the end of the pipe, we get the top 5 procedures.  Our phrases are getting longer!

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  count( procedure_short_desc, sort = TRUE )  %>%
  head( 5 )

```

 `count` has a descending sort built in to it, but sometimes we want to have more control over how we sort our data. Below, we use `arrange` to get the 10 *least* frequent procedures

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  count( procedure_short_desc) %>%
  arrange( n ) %>%
  head(10)

```

### Exercises

1.  What is the most prevalent cardiac block?  Most prevalent los?  drg?

1.  Show only the ages and lengths of stay of men who had cardiac procedures.

1.  How many different seperation modes are there?  How many drg's?

1.  Create another tibble called `top_5_diagnosis`, containing the top 5 most frequent diagnosis codes


## Piping into ggplot

You can also plot directly from a pipe.  Lets compare the number of men and women who had cardiac procedures.  Note, I select out distinct admissions so that we don't double count admissions that had more than one procedure.

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  distinct( admission_id, sex_desc, block_desc ) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = block_desc, fill=sex_desc))

```

## Refining a graph - labelling
The graph need better titles.  Here, I modify the title, x and y labels and legend label.

```{r }

cardiac_procedures %>%
  distinct( admission_id, sex_desc, block_desc ) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = block_desc, fill=sex_desc)) +
    ggtitle( 'Raw cardiac repair by gender and repair type') +
    ylab('Number of Patients') +
    xlab('Block Description') +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = 'Sex' )

```

## Refining a graph - label text wrapping

Pretty well anything you want to do in R, someone else has wanted to do it previously.

I noted that the text on the x axis was too long, and after a few tries, I came up the the google search 'how to wrap text on x axis ggplot'.  The Stack Overflow site suggested using the `scales` package.  After a few tries to get find the appropriate number of characters to wrap at, I came up with the following.


```{r, message=F, warning=F}

library(scales)

cardiac_procedures %>%
  distinct( admission_id, sex_desc, block_desc ) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = block_desc, fill=sex_desc)) +
    ggtitle( 'Raw cardiac repair by gender and repair type') +
    ylab('Number of Patients') +
    xlab('Block Description') +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = 'Sex' ) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = wrap_format(40)) +
    coord_flip()

```

### Exercises

1.  Create a plot comparing the number of people in each of the different seperation modes

1.  Do the same as above, but for only men

1.  For the most frequent care type, what is the gender breakdown of patients?
