Notice that we now have a variable in the top right environment pane, called fracture.  Click on it to investigate it.  Close it when you are finished.

# The process of data science
![Data Science Exploration Process (Grolemund & Wickham, 2017](./data-science-explore.png)

Data science is the process of getting data, and manipulating , visualizing and modelling it.  This is this week's task.  

# Data Transformation
It is very useful to use *pipes* (signified by %>% and ->) to transform data step by step.  They are easy to test and visualise, in that you can highlight a small chunk of the pipe, and run it by itself. In this next section, we will add five variables to the fracture dataset:  charge_status, practicioner, year_of_service, age, and age_group_10 (10 year age group).  The data flows through a pipe, going from fracture, mutating into another variable, and then going back to fracture.  The mutations are done using transformation functions,  including: ifelse, substring, as.integer, and cut. 

The function ifelse takes 3 arguments:  a condition, the return value if the condition is true, and the return value if the condition is false.   It is useful for creating categorical variables.  The cut function cuts a continuous variable into chunks at the position of designated breaks, in this case, 10 year age groups.

```{r more_transformations}
library(tidyverse)

fracture %>%
  mutate( charge_status =   ifelse( feecharged > schedfee,
                                   "overcharged", 
                                   "standard charge") ) -> fracture
#
fracture %>%
  mutate( practicioner  =  ifelse( item=='07647',  
                                  "Generalist", 
                                  "Specialist") ) -> fracture
#
fracture %>%
  mutate( year_of_service = as.integer( substring( date_of_service, 1, 4 ))) -> fracture
#

fracture %>%
  mutate( age = year_of_service - yob, 
         age_group_10 = cut(age, breaks=10*(0:12))) -> fracture

```

1. Highlight and run different chunks of the above statements, to see what the pipeline is doing.  
2. Create and add to fracture another variable, called age_group_20, and put in it ages categorised into 20 year age groups.  

# Visualise and cleanup a health dataset
Firstly, we look at the distribution of fee charged.  

```{r error_histogram, warnings=FALSE}
ggplot( fracture ) + 
  geom_histogram ( mapping=aes(x=feecharged))
```

Note that feecharged ranges from -150,000 to 200,000. We will eliminate outliers by using a pipe to filter out these values. In the filter expression, *&* means AND.  The histogram has improved.  Note, I put the data into a new variable, called fracture_2, because we have irrevocably changed it. 

```{r filter, warnings=FALSE}
fracture %>% 
  filter( feecharged >=0 & feecharged <50000) -> fracture_2

ggplot( fracture_2 ) + 
  geom_histogram ( mapping=aes(x=feecharged))

```

# Model - Gender
It is useful to start with demographics.  What gender gets ankle fractures?

```{r plot_age_sex}
ggplot( fracture_2, mapping=aes(x=sex, fill=sex) ) + 
  geom_bar( ) 
```

We use a chi squared test to tell if this difference is statistically significant. We will pipe fracture_fixeds into the *table* function, which counts the number of levels of each variable.  *Prop.table* calculates the proportions for each variable (think percentages), and *chisq.test* performs the chisquared value. If P-value is less than 0.05, the difference is significant.

```{r count_sex}

fracture_2 %>% 
  select(sex) %>% 
  table() 

fracture_2 %>% 
  select(sex) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  prop.table()

fracture_2 %>% 
  select(sex) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  chisq.test()
```
1. Is there a significant difference between generalist and specialist attendences?
2. Is there a significant difference between the genders in the 40-50 year old range? (hint: use filter to exclude the other ages )

Are women or men more likely go to specialists?  It is hard to tell from the graph alone, but the chi squared test rejects this hypothesis.

```{r count_sex_practicioner}
ggplot( fracture_2, mapping=aes(x=practicioner, fill=sex) ) + 
  geom_bar( ) 

fracture_2 %>% 
  select(sex, practicioner) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  prop.table()

fracture_2 %>% 
  select(sex, practicioner) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  chisq.test()

```
For more information on use of chisquared test in R, see: <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych252/cheatsheets/chisquare.html">https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych252/cheatsheets/chisquare.html</a>

1. Are specialists more likely to overcharge than generalists? 

```{r charge_answer, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

ggplot( fracture_2, mapping=aes(fill=practicioner, x=charge_status) ) + 
  geom_bar( ) 

fracture_2 %>% 
  select(charge_status, practicioner) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  prop.table()

fracture_2 %>% 
  select(charge_status, practicioner) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  chisq.test()
```

# Modeling  - age and gender
Is the age range of people who break their ankle different for the different genders?  Is this a significant difference?  A t-test can tell if the male ages are different from the female ages.  


```{r plot_gender_over_age, echo=TRUE}
p<- ggplot( fracture_2, mapping=aes(x=age, fill=sex) ) 
p+ geom_bar( ) 

t.test( age~sex, data=fracture_2)

```
1. Is the age range different for people who go to specialist vs generalists?
2. Is the age range different for people who are overcharged?


```{r plot_gender_over_age_ANSWER, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot( fracture_2, mapping=aes(x=age, fill=practicioner) )  +
  geom_bar( ) 
t.test( age~practioner, data=fracture_2)

ggplot( fracture_2, mapping=aes(x=age, fill=charge_status) )  +
  geom_bar( ) 
t.test( age~charge_status, data=fracture_2)

```

# Modelling - is the price increasing over time?

Is the price increasing?  Is the increase significant?

```{r plot_paid_over_time, warnings=FALSE}
ggplot( fracture_2, mapping=aes(x=date_of_service, 
                                y=feecharged, 
                                color=practicioner) )  +
                                    geom_point( )  + 
                                    geom_smooth()
```

# Merilyn's AHB assignment

In Merilyn's AHB assignment, you have to 

1. Using the ICD10 code(s) for your disease,  connect to the vaed_full database and retrieve your admissions
2. Is there a significant diffence between the genders for your disease?
3. Choose the 2 most popular versions of your disease.  Is there a significant difference between the length of stay (LOS) for these 2 versions?
