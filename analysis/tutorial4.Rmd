# Statistics in R

Merilyn has asked you to do some statistics on her AHB assignment.  This section will show you how to do this.  We will retrieve some fracture information from the PBS database, and see if there is a difference between male and female occurence of fracture.  

The dataset includes the fracture description, patient sex and year of birth, and both the fee charged and the scheduled fee.  Again, start this tutorial using a new RScript file, and load the `tidyverse` library.

```{r initial_setup, echo=TRUE, warnings=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library("RPostgreSQL")
query <- " 
 SELECT m.feecharged, m.schedfee, m.item,  m.service_date, d.description, p.sex, p.yob
 FROM mbs m
 JOIN mbs_desc_latest d USING (item)
 JOIN patient p USING (pin)
 where item in  ('07647', '07652'); 
 "
con <- dbConnect(dbDriver("PostgreSQL"), 
                 dbname   = 'pbs',
                 host = "himsql7.latrobe.edu.au", port = 5432,
                 user = "dewollershei-test", password = "healthGuru")
#
fracture <- dbGetQuery( con, query ) %>% as_tibble() 
#
fracture
#
dbDisconnect( con )


```
Notice that we now have a new variable in the top right environment pane, called fracture.  Click on it to investigate it.  Close it when you are finished.

# The process of data science
![Data Science Exploration Process (Grolemund & Wickham, 2017](screens/tutorial4_2_data-science-explore.png)

Data science is the process of getting data, and manipulating , visualizing and modelling it.  This is this week's task.  

# Data Transformation
In the previous tutorials, we used pipes to select and summarise the data.  In this section, we will use pipes to `mutate` the data, adding calculated fields.  

We will add five fields to the fracture dataset:  charge_status, practicioner, service_year, age, and age_group_10 (10 year age group).  The data flows through a pipe, using the mutate function to add (or change) a field.

fracture -> mutate -> fracture.  

The mutations use transformation functions: `ifelse`, `substring`, `as.integer`, and `cut`. 

The function `ifelse` is similar to the `if` function in Excel. It takes 3 arguments:  
1.  a condition, 
1.  the return value if the condition is true, and 
2.  the return value if the condition is false.   
   
It is useful for creating categorical variables.  

The `cut` function slices a continuous variable into chunks, in this case, 10 year age groups.
l;

```{r more_transformations}
library(tidyverse)

# we say it was overcharged if the practicioner charged more than the scheduled fee
fracture <-
  fracture %>%
    mutate( charge_status =   ifelse( feecharged > schedfee,
                                    "overcharged", 
                                    "standard charge") ) 
# 07647 is the generalist code
fracture <- 
  fracture %>%
    mutate( practicioner  =  ifelse( item=='07647',  
                                    "Generalist", 
                                    "Specialist") ) 

# The year is the first 4 digits of the date
fracture <- 
  fracture %>%
    mutate( service_year = as.integer( substring( service_date, 1, 4 ))) 

# first calculate the age at the time of service, and 
# then use cut to slice up the ages into 10 year age groups
# note you can do 2 mutations in the same sentence
fracture <- 
  fracture %>%
    mutate( age = service_year - yob, 
          age_group_10 = cut(age, breaks=10*(0:12))) 

```
### Exercises

1. Highlight and run `0:12` in the above sentence.  What does it do?  Highlight and run `10*(0:12)`.  What does it do?  
1. What R phrase would create a list of numbers between 1 and 100?  How about the even numbers between 1 and 100?  What about the numbers 20,40,60,80 and 100?   
1. Create another field in `fracture` to hold 20 year age groups.  

# Visualise and clean the fractures dataset

What is the range and distribution of the `fee charged` field?

```{r error_histogram, warnings=FALSE}
ggplot( fracture ) + 
  geom_histogram ( mapping=aes(x=feecharged))
```

Note that `feecharged` ranges from -150,000 to 200,000. We will eliminate outliers, using a pipe to filter out these values. In the filter expression, `&` means AND.  The histogram has improved.  

```{r filter, warnings=FALSE}

# we want the records that have feecharged between 0 and 50000
fracture <- 
  fracture %>% 
    filter( feecharged >=0 & feecharged <50000)

ggplot( fracture ) + 
  geom_histogram ( mapping=aes(x=feecharged))

```

# Create a model of gender and ankle fractures

What gender gets these ankle fractures?  A good first step is to plot the data.

```{r plot_age_sex}

ggplot( fracture, mapping=aes(x=sex, fill=sex) ) + 
  geom_bar( ) 

```

## Statistical Significant Differences - Chi Squared test

There appears to be a difference between the number of men and women who get ankle fractures.  Is this difference statistically significant?  The chi squared test answers this question. We select the `sex` field from fracture , and then pipe it into the `table` function. `table` counts the number of levels of each variable, in this case, M and F.


```{r count_sex}

fracture %>% 
  select(sex) %>% 
  table() 


```

 `chisq.test` performs the chisquared test. If P-value is less than 0.05, the difference is significant.  This means that this difference would happen by chance less than 5 / 100 times. 

```{r chisq_sex}

fracture %>% 
  select(sex) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  chisq.test()

```

The chi squared test above tells us that this difference, between men and women, is not due to chance.  Note, the value is expressed in scientific notation (`p-value = 1.187e-09`), because it is so small.  In regular notation, this would be 0.0000000001187!   


### Exercises

1. Is there a significant difference between generalist and specialist attendences?
2. Is there a significant difference between the genders in the 40-50 year old range? (hint: use filter to exclude the other ages )

## Modelling gender and specialist seeking behaviour
Are women or men more likely go to specialists?    Again, we first plot the data.

```{r count_sex_practicioner}
ggplot( fracture, mapping=aes(x=practicioner, fill=sex) ) + 
  geom_bar( ) 

```

Again, the graph alone does not answer the question.  It appears that more women go than men, but this might be due to chance.  Let's do a 2 variable chisquared test.

```{r chisq_sex_practicioner}


fracture %>% 
  select(sex, practicioner) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  chisq.test()

```
The chi squared test rejects this hypothesis that women are more likely to go to specialists, this difference may be due to chance.

For more information on use of chisquared test in R, see: <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych252/cheatsheets/chisquare.html">https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych252/cheatsheets/chisquare.html</a>

### Exercises

1. Are specialists more likely to overcharge than generalists?   (answer below)


# Modeling - is there a difference between two groups?
Do the different genders break their their ankles at different ages?  We first visualise.

```{r plot_gender_over_age, echo=TRUE}
ggplot( fracture, mapping=aes(x=age, fill=sex) )  + 
  geom_bar( ) +
  facet_wrap( ~sex )

```

It appears that men break their ankle in their youth, while women (except for those 2 years of netball) are more likely to break their ankle when they get older. 

A t-test can show if the set of male ages are significantly different from the set of female ages.  

```{r t_test_age_sex}

t.test( age~sex, data=fracture)

```
Again, because the p-value is less than .05, the different is unlikely due to chance.  

### Exercises
1. Is the age range different for people who go to specialist vs generalists?
2. Is the age range different for people who are overcharged?

# Modelling - is the price increasing over time?

Is the incidence of overcharging increasing over time?  To visualise this, we count the number of overcharges per year, and plot them.  When we use `ggplot` as part of a pipe, we don't need to include `ggplot( fracture )`, because the dataset is piped into ggplot.


```{r plot_overcharge_over_time, warnings=FALSE}

fracture %>%
  filter( charge_status == 'overcharged') %>%
  count( service_year ) %>%
  ggplot( mapping=aes(x=service_year, y=n ) )  +
  geom_point( )  + 
  geom_smooth(color='black')

```

It is hard to tell if this is a real increase.   We can model it as a linear model, and see if the increase is significant.

```{r}

fracture.lm <-
  fracture %>%
  filter( charge_status == 'overcharged') %>%
  count( service_year ) %>%
  mutate( years = as.integer( service_year  - min(service_year ))) %>%
  lm( years  ~ n, data=. )

summary( fracture.lm )
```

The model says that this is not a linear trend.

# Merilyn's AHB assignment

In Merilyn's AHB assignment, you have to :

1. Using the ICD10 code(s) for your disease,  connect to the vaed_full database and retrieve your admissions
2. Is there a significant diffence in the incidence of your disease between the genders ?
3. Choose 2 versions of your disease (e.g. gender, age ).  Is there a significant difference between the length of stay (LOS) for these 2 versions?
