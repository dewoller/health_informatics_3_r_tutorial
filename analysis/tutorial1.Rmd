In this tutorial, you will be going using two web browser windows, reading notes and exercise from the R for Data Science book, and doing the exercises in Rstudio

## Open two webbrowser windows

 - https://him-rstudio.latrobe.edu.au/
 - https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps

## In Rstudio, create a new .Rmd file (File -> new -> R Notebook)

```{r tutorial1_1_new_file, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Create New Rmd File", out.width='50%', fig.align='left' }
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial1_1_new_file.jpg")
```
## Delete Boilerplate text
Delete the default boilerplate text in lines 6-18 (leave the header intact), and insert a single R code section.

```{r tutorial1_2_delete_boiler_plate_text, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Delete boiler plate text", out.width='100%', fig.align='left' }
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial1_2_delete_boiler_plate_text.jpg")
```
```{r tutorial1_4_first_segment, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="First segment inserted", out.width='100%', fig.align='left' }
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial1_4_first_segment.jpg")
```

## Load the tidyverse library
Ignore the library load warning text.  Note, you only get this text the first time you load the library
```{r tutorial1_5_tidyverse, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Load tidyverse", out.width='30%', fig.align='left' }
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial1_5_tidyverse.jpg")
```

## [R for Data Science exercises](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps)

Do each exercise from from section 3.2 to 3.6 in https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#first-steps in a new R code section in your notebook.

 - Write notes in the white space between code sections.
 - Only type / paste in the dark blue code;  the lighter blue text shows the expected results
 - For example, the images below show what you need to type for the first two examples
 - Ignore section 3.2.3
 - If you copy/paste the code, make sure you do the exercises, to aid retention.  You are learning a new language, and you need some practice to get accustomed to the flow.

```{r tutorial1_6_mpg, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Show mpg dataset", out.width='100%', fig.align='left' }
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial1_6_mpg.jpg")
```

```{r tutorial1_7_graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Your first graph", out.width='70%', fig.align='left' }
knitr::include_graphics("screens/tutorial1_7_graph.jpg")
```
